# Tessellate - Visual Moodboarding Ecosystem Consolidation

> **A comprehensive view of the modular visual moodboarding platform built with SDK-first architecture**

## 🎯 Project Overview

Tessellate is a modular ecosystem for a visual moodboarding app that enables users to discover products, create curated collections, and export to major design platforms. Built with SDK-first architecture principles, each feature is extracted into reusable SDKs that can be shared across multiple projects.

### Core Vision
- **Two-sided marketplace**: Brands get discovered through visual product placement, shoppers discover brands through curated moodboards
- **Magazine-style lookbook creation**: Think Polyvore for 2025 with AI-powered curation
- **Platform integration**: Seamless export to Canva, Figma, and Adobe Creative Suite
- **Sustainable commerce**: Anti fast-fashion focus with ethical brand verification
